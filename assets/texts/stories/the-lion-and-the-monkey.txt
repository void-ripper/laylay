Once upon a time in a lush green forest filled with towering trees, blooming flowers, and cascading waterfalls, there lived an ancient and wise monkey known as Bwana. Bwana was revered not only by the 
animals of the forest but also by the guardians of nature themselves. It is said that he possessed secrets, wisdom, and insights beyond the comprehension of mortal beings.

In this land, a quest had been passed down from one generation to another – to solve an ancient riddle left behind by the ancestors. Whoever solves this riddle would be granted immense knowledge and power 
unparalleled in their world. Many had tried but none succeeded; they either died trying or returned defeated, their minds tangled in the intricacy of the riddle's puzzle.

One day, a young lion named Mufasa, inspired by tales told around campfires, set out on his journey to solve this enigma. He roamed across valleys and traversed mountains, seeking answers from every 
corner of the land. Finally, after years of traveling, Mufasa stumbled upon Bwana's abode - a grotto nestled between two massive baobab trees.

The old monkey received him kindly, offering fruits in exchange for stories. Mufasa shared his journey thus far and confided in Bwana that he had come to seek the solution to an ancient riddle. The wise 
monkey smiled knowingly, his furry face wrinkled with age and wisdom.

Mufasa presented the first part of the riddle - "What has a heart that does not beat?". Bwana pondered for a moment, then reached out and plucked an almond from a nearby tree. He cracked it open to reveal 
its kernel, handing it to Mufasa. The young lion understood - the answer was 'A Nut'.

For each part of the riddle presented by Mufasa, Bwana provided a piece of wisdom in response, teaching patience and humility through his actions. When the final part of the riddle came – "What goes 
nowhere but gets worn out?" - Mufasa sat quietly, realizing that he had gained much from this quest without even needing to solve the riddle.

Bwana saw the change within him and gently said, "My young friend, the answer is 'A Wheel'. But know this, true wisdom lies in embracing life's journey and not only in the destination." Moved by Bwana's 
words, Mufasa thanked him, feeling a newfound understanding of self.

The bond between the young lion and the ancient monkey grew deeper as Mufasa returned to visit his mentor often. In time, he too became an elder of the forest, carrying with him the lessons imparted by 
Bwana – that the key to any riddle or challenge in life was patience, wisdom, and humility. And so, the legend of Bwana, the wise old monkey who held the keys to many a riddle, grew even more entrenched 
within the folklore of the forest for generations to come.
