In the mystical realm of Eldrid, where magic and creatures of myth coexisted, there lived a powerful wizard named Alistair. With long silver hair and piercing green eyes, he was known for his 
extraordinary skills in arcane arts - but what many didn't know was that Alistair was a gay wizard.

One midsummer night, as the full moon cast its mystic glow over Eldrid, Alistair attended a grand ball hosted by King Arthos at the Royal Palace. In the midst of the dancing and celebration, he caught 
sight of a mesmerizing figure - a young man with silky black hair, violet eyes that seemed to hold the stars themselves, and an elegant tail that swayed like autumn leaves in the wind.

This was Eryx, a half-cat boy blessed by the moon goddess Selene. His graceful movements and enchanting smile captivated Alistair's heart. They soon found themselves dancing under the silver light, 
sharing stories and laughter. A deep connection formed between them, one that went beyond their differences in species and magic.
